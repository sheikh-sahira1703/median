                For finding the median of individual series, you need to sort all the elements in the data series <br>
                Formula for median of individual series is given by<br>

                For finding the median of discrete series, make a new column in the data series called cumulative frequency and in that column, write the cumulative total of the frequency after each observation in the discrete series <br>
                Then find the value of (n+1)/2, if the value of cumulative frequency above the particular row is less than (n+1)/2 and the value of the cumulative frequency is more than (n+1)/2 for a column below that row, then the value of x in that row becomes the median<br>

            <ol>
                <li>We can’t find combined median </li>
                <li>Median is not considering the values, it considers the position and not the values. Hence it is used for qualitative analysis (where we do not pay much attention to the value of the data points) </li>
                <li>We have different methods to calculate median so median can be different for different methods but mean is same </li>
